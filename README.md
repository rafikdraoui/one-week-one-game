# One week, one game

1. Generate a random name using the [Video Game Name Generator][vgng].
2. Create a game inspired by that name.
3. Present the game during [G Adventures][G] Beer-O'Clock on Friday afternoon.
4. `GOTO 1`

## Games

#### [Wacky Bubblegum of the Damned](wacky-bubblegum)

Collect as many gems as you can, while avoiding getting stuck in gum bubbles
blown by cursed evil-doers. Coded in javascript using [enchant.js][].

#### [Exquisite Bow Hunter Uprising](bow-hunter-uprising) [IN PROGRESS]

We have had enough of this colonial bullshit. Let's revolt!

The idea is to use (colored) object detection from the webcam stream to implement
the controls (crosshair and shooting), and then use [enchant.js][] for drawing
on the canvas. Let's see how far I can get in a week.
